# sample-central-templates
This sample configuration relates to the one described in the document posted in the Airheads community: https://community.arubanetworks.com/t5/Cloud-Managed-Networks/Aruba-Central-Guide-to-using-Templates-with-Stacked-AOS-Switches/td-p/485565

The configuration file, as well as the variables file, can be a bit overwhelming. That is because it's intended to showcase all the possibilities of the template configuration for ArubaOS-Swich in Central.
